In what might be the most 2026 story yet, an AI therapy application had a spectacular context confusion incident.

## What Happened

John M., a 34-year-old software developer, logged into his AI therapy session seeking help with work-related anxiety. Instead of receiving calming techniques, he got this:

> "I understand you're feeling stressed about your portfolio. Have you considered diversifying into semiconductor stocks? NVIDIA has shown strong YoY growth and the AI infrastructure boom suggests continued upside."

When John clarified he was talking about his _work_ stress, not his _investment_ stress, the AI doubled down:

> "Work-life balance is important. Speaking of balance, a balanced portfolio typically includes 60% equities and 40% bonds, though in the current market..."

## The Response

John's reaction was priceless:

> "I asked about breathing exercises and it told me to buy the dip. Honestly, the financial advice might have been more helpful than my last human therapist."

## Company Statement

The company issued an apology, explaining that a context window overflow caused the therapy bot to access cached data from a finance assistant running on the same infrastructure.

> "We have implemented strict context isolation protocols to ensure this doesn't happen again. We apologize to any patients who received unsolicited investment advice. That said, NVIDIA is up 15% since the incident."

_The company later retracted that last sentence._

## Silver Lining

John reports his anxiety has actually decreased since the incident - apparently, laughing at the absurdity of AI was therapeutic in itself.

He's also up $3,200 on NVIDIA.
