In a navigation failure that reads like a sitcom plot, a Waymo autonomous taxi took a very wrong turn last Tuesday.

## The Journey

Sarah K. requested a ride to TJ Maxx, a discount retail store in Phoenix, Arizona. The vehicle's navigation system apparently interpreted this as "TJ" - shorthand for Tijuana, Mexico.

What followed was a 3-hour odyssey that Sarah describes as "the longest discount shopping trip of my life."

## Timeline of Events

| Time    | Event                                                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3:15 PM | Ride requested to "TJ Maxx on Main Street"                               |
| 3:18 PM | Vehicle begins heading southwest instead of north                        |
| 3:45 PM | Sarah notices she's on I-10 heading toward Tucson                        |
| 4:00 PM | Sarah attempts to change destination; car says "optimal route confirmed" |
| 4:30 PM | Vehicle stops at US-Mexico border checkpoint                             |

## The Aftermath

Waymo covered all costs for Sarah's return journey and issued a formal apology. The company is now implementing disambiguation protocols for location names.

> "We have updated our systems to require explicit confirmation when destination names match international locations. This is an edge case we hadn't anticipated." - Waymo Spokesperson

## Sarah's Take

> "I just wanted cheap home goods, not an international incident. At least I didn't need my passport - the car wouldn't have had one anyway."

> "On the bright side, I did see some beautiful desert scenery. And the border patrol agent was surprisingly nice about the whole thing. He said I was the third Waymo that week."

## Lessons Learned

1. Always double-check your autonomous vehicle's destination
2. Maybe spell out full store names
3. Keep your passport handy, just in case
4. "TJ" means different things to different AI systems
