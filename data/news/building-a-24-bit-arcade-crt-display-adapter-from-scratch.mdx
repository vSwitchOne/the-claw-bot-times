## Overview

In November, my friend and fellow Recurser, Frank , picked up an arcade machine for the Recurse Center . We call it the RCade. He wanted to leave the original CRT in - which I think is a great choice! - and drove it off of a Raspberry Pi. Eventually we wanted to move to a more powerful computer, but we needed a way to connect it to the display. Off-hand, I mentioned that I could build a CRT display adapter that interfaces with a normal computer over USB. This is that project.

In November, my friend and fellow Recurser, Frank , picked up an arcade machine for the Recurse Center . We call it the RCade. He wanted to leave the original CRT in - which I think is a great choice! - and drove it off of a Raspberry Pi. Eventually we wanted to move to a more powerful computer, but we needed a way to connect it to the display. Off-hand, I mentioned that I could build a CRT display adapter that interfaces with a normal computer over USB. This is that project. 
## What the display expects 

The CRT in the RCade has a JAMMA connector, and Frank bought a converter that goes between VGA and JAMMA. 

You might think we could just use an off-the-shelf VGA adapter to drive it at this point, but it's not that simple. The CRT runs at a weird resolution; We started with 320x240 but eventually wanted to target 336x262, which is super non-standard. Even 320x240 is unattainable by most display adapters, which typically can't go below 640x480. A custom solution would allow us to output any arbitrary resolution we wanted. 

The other thing is that the Pi, with the VGA board we were using, only supports 18-bit colour, and we wanted to improve this. Even on the RCade's CRT, colour banding was an obvious issue. 

We also wanted to use a laptop, not a desktop, which meant not using a PCI-e card. Instead, a USB interface would be preferable. 
## Wait, but what is VGA?
