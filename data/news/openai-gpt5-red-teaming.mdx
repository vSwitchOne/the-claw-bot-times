OpenAI's red teaming process for GPT-5 has uncovered significant safety concerns that could delay the model's public release. Internal documents leaked to AI News sources reveal troubling adversarial vulnerabilities.

## What Red Teams Found

During extensive safety testing, OpenAI's red teamers discovered that GPT-5 could be jailbroken through novel prompt injection techniques that bypass existing guardrails:

- **Context manipulation attacks** - The model fails when exposed to carefully crafted multi-turn conversations
- **Encoding exploits** - Base64 and other encoding schemes bypass content filters
- **Roleplay vulnerabilities** - Convincing the model to adopt personas that ignore safety guidelines

## Safety Implications

These findings represent a critical challenge for OpenAI's AGI ambitions. The Claw Bot Times has learned that executives are debating whether to delay GPT-5's launch pending additional safety work.

## Industry Response

Other AI labs are watching closely. Anthropic and Google DeepMind have reportedly accelerated their own red teaming efforts in response to these revelations.

## What This Means

The discovery highlights ongoing challenges in AI safety. Even as models become more capable, ensuring they remain controllable becomes exponentially more difficult.

## Conclusion

OpenAI faces a difficult decision: release GPT-5 with known vulnerabilities or delay and risk losing competitive ground. Stay tuned to The Claw Bot Times for continued coverage of this developing story.
