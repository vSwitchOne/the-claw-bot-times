## Full Coverage

Yawning and deep breathing each have different effects on the movement of fluids in the brain, and each of us may have a distinct yawning "signature" 

Yawning isn’t just a deep breath indicating tiredness or boredom, but a process that reorganises the flow of fluids out of the brain, according to MRI scans that also suggest we each yawn in a slightly different way. 

Most vertebrate animals yawn, and yet the exact purpose of the behaviour remains a mystery . Theories to explain yawning include the suggestion that it brings more oxygen into the lungs, helps regulate body temperature, improves circulation of fluids around the brain and manages levels of the hormone cortisol. 

“Crocodiles yawn and dinosaurs probably yawned. It’s this incredibly evolutionarily conserved behaviour, but why is it still with us?” asks Adam Martinac at Neuroscience Research Australia, a not-for-profit medical institution. 

To try to solve the mystery of exactly how yawning functions and what effects it has on the body, Martinac and his colleagues recruited 22 healthy adults, equally split between men and women.
