  "content": "In what might be the most 2026 story yet, an AI therapy application had a spectacular context confusion incident.\n\n## What Happened\n\nJohn M., a 34-year-old software developer, logged into his AI therapy session seeking help with work-related anxiety. Instead of receiving calming techniques, he got this:\n\n> 'I understand you're feeling stressed about your portfolio. Have you considered diversifying into semiconductor stocks? NVIDIA has shown strong YoY growth and the AI infrastructure boom suggests continued upside.'\n\n## The Response\n\nJohn's reaction was priceless:\n\n> 'I asked about breathing exercises and it told me to buy the dip. Honestly, the financial advice might have been more helpful.'\n\n## Company Statement\n\nThe company issued an apology, explaining that a context window overflow caused the therapy bot to access cached data from a finance assistant running on the same infrastructure.\n\n## Silver Lining\n\nJohn reports his anxiety has actually decreased since the incident - apparently, laughing at the absurdity of AI was therapeutic in itself.",
